# Unity_Tile-Based_Basics

I am currently working on a tile-based game that we will publish in few months. I am responsible on developing gameplay/game mechanics and game design.

I am not sharing full source code on GitHub for now, since we consider this game as a product.

In this code, I decided to separate core game code and Unity, and use Unity as just as a rendering tool as OpenGL, etc. So, the code is developed with this motivation.

Done:

    * Key classes for the game (controllers/managers, hierarchy for game objects, etc.)
    * Uniform grid base collision detection
    * Rectangle collision detection

Next:

    * Waiting for level editor to be completed for introducing text based level construction in LevelController
    * InputManager and observer pattern to increase decoupling in GameController
    * Some other updates and improvements depending on the new game design decisions.

P.S. GitHub shows some indentation issues that does not exist neither on MonoDevelop nor VS.
